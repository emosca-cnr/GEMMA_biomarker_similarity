# Assessment of functional similarity among Biomarkers

We developed a pipeline to assess the similarity among biomarkers. The approach uses network diffusion processes on molecular and functional interactions, as well as molecular pathways, to estimate the functional similarity between novel biomarkers and existing biomarkers. It can be applied to genes, metabolites and microbial species.

This pipeline is part of the [GEMMA Project Multi-Omics Toolbox](https://www.gemma-project.eu/toolbox)

Release: with the publication of articles by the GEMMA Consortium.
